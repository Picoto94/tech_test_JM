Assumptions and Justifications
During the development of this project, some assumptions were made to facilitate implementation and meet requirements. Here are some of the assumptions made and their justifications:

Date Format: It was assumed that all dates provided as input to the API endpoints will follow the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) to ensure consistency and ease of manipulation.

Data Validation: It was assumed that the data provided to the API endpoints will be validated before processing to ensure data integrity and security.
